# Matlab Optimization of a PID and a Black-Hole inspired controller

In this project, we present the optimization of two distinct controllers, a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) and a Black-Hole inspired controller, using MATLAB for an automation systems course. The objective was to achieve the fastest possible response without any overshoot. The implementation demonstrates the efficacy of these control methods in real-world applications. Explore the repository to see how modern optimization techniques were employed to achieve this goal.
The black hole inspired controller was not created by me.


## Features

- Real time monitoring of the iterations and the response variation.
- Iterates to find the minimum error.
- Nullifies overshoot by creating a penalty in the error should it happen.
- Only step input for now.


## Run Locally

After cloning the project and assuring you have matlab and simulink installed please make sure that you also installed the global optimization toolbox optimization toolbox.
